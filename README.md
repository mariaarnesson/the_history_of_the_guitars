[View the live project here](https://mariaarnesson.github.io/the_history_of_the_guitars/)

On my website you find the history of a very popular musical instrument, which is the guitar. I described where the guitar comes from and in which countries it is used, and also what different types of guitars exist. There is a timeline about the entire history of guitars too.

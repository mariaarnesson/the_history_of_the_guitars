# User Experience (UX)


[View the live project here](https://mariaarnesson.github.io/the_history_of_the_guitars/)

On my website you find the history of a very popular musical instrument, which is the guitar. I described where the guitar comes from and in which countries it is used, and also what different types of guitars exist. There is a timeline about the entire history of guitars too.

## Features
### Navigation Bar
- Featured on all five pages. the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the  Home page, Type of guitars, Gallery, Timeline,  and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

- This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
